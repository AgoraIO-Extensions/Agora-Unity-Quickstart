## How to run the sample project

#### Developer Environment Requirements

* Unity 2017 LTS and up

#### Steps to run

First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID.

Then do the following:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open the project in Unity Editor. Note that you will see compiler errors before you download the SDK package.

3. You may download the SDK package in either of the following two ways:

    a. From Unity Asset Store download and import [the Agora Video SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/video/agora-video-chat-sdk-for-unity-134502)

    b. Download the ******Agora Video SDK****** from [Agora.io SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/downloads?platform=Unity). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy the files from ******samples/Hello-Video-Unity-Agora/Assets/AgoraEngine/****** in SDK to ******API-Example-Unity/Assets/****** in project

4.  Choose one of the scene that you want to run

5.  Fill your App ID into the scene on the game controller (attached on VideoCanvas most likely), like the following example:
    ![api-sample-appid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261195/89360166-652da380-d67c-11ea-9e67-1e02bbe94fc5.png)

Run the game and you are now good to go!
